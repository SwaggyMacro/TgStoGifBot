## ü§ñ Telegram Sticker Bot

Feature:
- Convert Telegram sticker(`tgs`) to GIF, PNG, APNG, and WEBP.
- Convert Telegram sticker sets to GIF, PNG, APNG, and WEBP.
- Download `.tgs` files(including sticker sets).

ü§ñ Demo Bot: [@sticker_to_gif_01_bot](https://t.me/sticker_to_gif_01_bot)  
Sticker set conversion has been `disabled` on this bot to minimize resource usage and prevent abuse. Only `single sticker` can be converted to GIF, PNG, APNG, or WEBP. However, downloading the full .tgs files of sticker sets is `still allowed`.

### üìù System Requirements
---
Install run-time dependencies. Make sure the path to them present in PATH variable:

- **[gifski](https://gif.ski)** if you want to convert to GIF
- **[ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org)** if you want to convert to APNG
- **[img2webp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/img2webp)** if you want to convert to WEBP

gifski is the only dependency required to convert to GIF, `gif only` in this repo, you may skip the rest if you don't
want to convert to APNG or WEBP.

- gifski
    - Ubuntu: Install gifski using the following command in three different ways:
      ```bash
      brew install gifski
